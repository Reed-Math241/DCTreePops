Description: DC_Tree_Pop combines data from the U.S. Census Bureau and DC GIS to explore how population and tree density relate. The data are composed of 179 unique, spatially defined census-tracts and include additional information on an area's GeoID, land area composition, and size. This data would be useful for anyone interested in a more macro-level analysis of tree population or for someone interested in investigating the effects of urban expansion and the environment in Washington D.C.
